# Budget-Calculator
Input your income and you get a budget break down 

# The Budget
The budget breakdown is based on the 50-30-20 budget.
* 50% of you budget goes towards your needs (bills)
* 30% goes to your wants (spending)
* 20% goes to your saving

This is according to the original idea, but I change the spending and saving calculations based on my savings goals.
